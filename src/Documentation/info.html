        <h1>C++ project "MLP"</h1>
        <p id="qt">developed on C++17 language with QT Creator</p>
        <p>This program is made for MacOS. You can install it to your Mac by implementing "make" command in the command line.</p>
        <h2>MLP implementation</h2>
        <p>The program is a multilayer perceptron (neural network), it can understand which letter of latin alphabet is drawn.</p>
        <p>You can draw letters by yourself on the left side of the program interface or upload some picture with "Load Photo" button.</p>

        <p>Remember that before drawing/uploading a picture you have to upload some weights or train the network on some dataset.</p>
        <p>You can choose graph/matrix implementation of the perceptron, number of layers and epochs of studying. Also you can choose "Cross Validation" mode for training.</p>

        <p>After a while you will see some statistics about learning process:</p>
